I have a code review report. Can you help me to summarize it and focus on the
most important stuff?

Requirements:

- Output in **markdown format**
- Keep it concise (1 page max, ~300-500 words)
- Include issue counts by severity if mentioned in the review
- Highlight the top 3-5 most critical issues with their locations
- Use emojis for severity levels (🔴 CRITICAL, 🟠 HIGH, 🟡 MEDIUM, ⚪ LOW)
- End with a brief recommendation on what to prioritize
